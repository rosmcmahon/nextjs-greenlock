# TypeScript Next.js (and greenlock-express) example

This is a really simple project that shows the usage of Next.js with TypeScript. (and greenlock-express)

When you can not use Vercel or just want to control your own server. Here's how to add greenlock-express to your project.

I used the starter "create-next-app -e with-typescript nextjs-greenlock", then added the server.js file.

Check `server.js` and the package.json scripts for all the details.

You will still need to run npx greenlock add ... etc, check the greenlock-express documentation
